# Student-GUI

This is a GUI application based on the idea of a student capturing system. A student can be added to the system when a studentId, year of study and 3 module choices are chosen. The system also ensures that some editing can take place; as well as the deletion of a student from the system. 

To develop this project, I used JavaFX on IntelliJ IDEA.
